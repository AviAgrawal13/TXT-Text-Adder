# TXT-Text-Adder

With this simple python program you can add any text you would like, to a TXT. 
For example, lets say you have a TXT with the lines.   

Hi    
Bye     
Cya      

Then you would run the script, and it will output another TXT with the desired text. 
For example, let's add .com, this would be the output.   

Hi.com    
Bye.com     
Cya.com
