# TXT-Text-Adder

With this simple python program you can add any text you would like, to a TXT. 
For example, lets say you have a TXT with the lines.   

Hi    
Bye     
Cya      

Then you would run the script, and it will output another TXT with the desired text. 
For example, let's add .com, this would be the output.   

Hi.com    
Bye.com     
Cya.com      



Directions of use, 

MUST HAVE PYTHON DOWNLOADED!

Download the folder like it is, then edit the script. Where it says .com, change it to whatever you would like. If you have any issues or would like some help, please create an issue.
